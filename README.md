Check out my [Personal Website](https://ianballard.github.io/) built on this [template](https://github.com/ianballard/personal-website-starter) I made.

I have a BS in computer science and applied mathematics with certifications in AWS, Java, and SQL Server. 

I currently work at Jahnel Group as a senior software engineer and I love it there.
